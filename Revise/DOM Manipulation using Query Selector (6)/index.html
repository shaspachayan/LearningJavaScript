      //Query Selector

      //There are 3 main selectors that we are familiar with in CSS , here is the same case
      // --> tag name
      // --> id with the help of #
      // --> class with the help of .

      // we have a query selector and a query selectorall , for now lets use the query selector. 1st tag name , lets think we have to select all the children of body and it self, how we can do this?

      //   document.querySelector("body"); // now lets put this in a variable and console.log
      //   const body = document.querySelector("body");
      //   console.log(body); // see in devtools console we got the  body and its children
      // where we need this? Suppose we want to do a specfic operation for a certain period of time then it is what we can use for.

      //   body.innerHTML = "<h1>HACKED </h1>"; //it basically, discards all the codes we have in our code and replace it with this.

      // Suppose we are selecting the div and we have multiple div in our code, then what will happen? We said we have a querySelector and we have querySelectorAll, querySelector selects only the first apperance , that what div is 1st that will be selectwd and querySelectorAll will select all the mentioned tag.

      //Assignment 01
      //   change the console.log and print in the screen alert hello
      const pre = document.querySelector("code");
      pre.innerHTML = "<h1> Alert HElloW </h1>";
      console.log(pre);

      // Now our target is by id, now we have to chage the name and put another name to it

      const username = document.querySelector("#Username");
      //   console.log(username);
      username.innerText = "Bittu"; // basically we can see that inside the code there is no html in username so we decide to go with innerText. innerHtml will also work fine.

      // now using class

      const paragraph = document.querySelector(".paragraph");
      paragraph.innerHTML = "<h4> EAYYYY... <?/h4>";
      console.log(paragraph);

      //now the differnce between querySelector and querySelectorAll is that all retrurns a array of similar type we quering for and only selector returns the 1st apperence of query.

      //   now lets see
      const all = document.querySelectorAll(".paragraph");
      all.forEach((e) => {
        console.log(e.innerHTML); // basi
      });
