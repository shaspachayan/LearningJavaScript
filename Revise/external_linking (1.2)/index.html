    <h1>External Linking</h1>
    <p>
      External linking is linking the js file inside the html file <br />
      That is, in big production it is not desirable that you are writing the
      whole code inside the body of html so we write our js code sepertly and
      link it with index.html with script tag with attribute src.
    </p>

    <script src="helloWorld.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
